            A confident, social-media savvy and business-minded individual, I relish any opportunity to talk about and promote what I’m passionate about, either through blogging or public speaking. 
            As a graduate of CodeYourFuture’s Full Stack Web Development programme, and following on from a wealth of experience in business and communications, I have a skill-set ranging from front-end frameworks like React and Bootstrap to database management in SQL.
            I’m seeking a position in a fast-paced environment where I can put my web development skills to use and keep learning every day.
